Linsys/Sipura SPA9xx provisioning
=================================

What you will find here is a set of scripts I've created to ease the deployment
of SPA9xx phones.

Here is the boot process of a SPA9xx phone, with factory defaults:
1) Grab an IP address from the DHCP server.
2) Download the initial configuration file from the TFT server. It will default
to the DHCP server, if not specificied in the DHCP response. The name of this
file is "spa9xx.cfg".

On this initial file, we'll rewrite the "Profile Rule", i.e., the URL where the
phone downloads it's configuration. We'll point it to a PHP-enabled web server,
specifying the model and MAC address of the phone. Also, we'll force the phone
to fetch this URL fast (10 seconds, default is 3600).

<flat-profile>
<Profile_Rule ua="na">http://x.x.x.x/provisioning/config.php?model=9xx&mac=$MA</Profile_Rule>
<Resync_Periodic ua="na">10</Resync_Periodic>
<Resync_Error_Retry_Delay ua="na">10</Resync_Error_Retry_Delay>
<Resync_Fails_On_FNF ua="na">Yes</Resync_Fails_On_FNF>
</flat-profile>

After the timeout, the phone will fetch this URL, and a full configuration will
be retrieved and activated.

The config.php script will parse some configuration templates (in /etc/provisioning),
and will produce a XML reponse for the phone.

These templates are read in specific order, to give maximun flexibility to the
deployer (yes, that's you):
1) 9xx-default.cfg: This file contains the factory default settings of the phone
model. More on how to generate this file later.
2) global.cfg: General customizations to the default settings. This should not include
any deployment-specific settings.
3) site.cfg: Specific settings for a particular deployment. It usually includes
proxy server IP, NTP and syslog server, regional settings, logos, etc.
4) 9xx-{MAC}.cfg: Phone-specific settings. Basically, the extension number and pasword.

A template consists on a series of key:value pairs. Every template's settings
override the previous ones, in cascade.

I'm including a little script (xml2cfg) to parse the xml configuration as downloaded 
from the phone (http://x.x.x.y/admin/spacfg.xml), and generate the 9xx-default.cfg 
template file.

CHANGELOG
=========
* 14-08-2008: Initial release. Based on a PAP2 provisioning scripts I wrote time ago.

LICENCE
=======
GPL v2.

TODO
====
* Move the configuration template to a database
* Web GUI for configuring phones
* Web GUI for configuring new phones. Just plug the phone, enter the web GUI and a 
  list of unrecognized phones should appear.
* Have a way to generate static cfg files, so that the only critical service is the
  tftp server.
